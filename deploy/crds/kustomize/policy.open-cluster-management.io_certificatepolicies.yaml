          CertificatePolicy is the schema for the certificatepolicies API. Certificate policy monitors
          certificates on a cluster against user-defined restrictions, and it returns a noncompliance
          status if any certificate does not meet the requirements of the parameters. By default the
          certificate policy uses the 'tls.crt' key of a secret to find the certificate, but you can use an
          alternate key if specified in the 'certificate_key_name' label on the secret.
